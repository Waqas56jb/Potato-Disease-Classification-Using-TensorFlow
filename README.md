This project demonstrates the development of a deep learning model for classifying potato leaf diseases using TensorFlow. The model aims to identify and classify various diseases affecting potato plants, contributing to agricultural management and improved crop yield.

## Key Features
- **Disease Classification**: Accurately classify potato leaf diseases, including Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implement techniques such as rotation, zoom, horizontal flip, and brightness adjustment to enhance model robustness.
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieve high accuracy on the test dataset with optimized model training and evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Visualize model predictions, augmented images, and performance metrics using Matplotlib.
